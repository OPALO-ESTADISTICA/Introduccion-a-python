    "**Business Context.** Global electricity production, consumption, import, and export is complex and interesting for a variety of reasons. Each country has to keep track of a vast array of information to ensure that they produce enough electricity, yet balance these needs against medium-term financial implications and environmental concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an analyst working at a non-governmental organization (NGO) that reports on global energy trends. Your department has obtained a large CSV file, but your colleagues are battling to extract relevant insights from it using Excel due to its size and format. Worse still, it has thousands of variables and they are not sure which ones are interesting. Thus, you have been made responsible for supporting your team's journalists by providing them with data and insights that they can turn into written reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.**  Your task is to **understand the information that is available and extract key insights for an upcoming report on global power patterns**. Specifically, your team wants you to answer the following four questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How much power is produced?\n",
    "2. How much power is consumed?\n",
    "3. How much power is imported and exported? \n",
    "4. How much of this power is renewable?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The data is stored in the `all_energy_statistics.csv` file containing information on power production and consumption by country and year. You will: 1) manipulate the data to create more categories from the existing columns; and 2) find the biggest players in different categories related to the research questions."

For example, not all numerical data in the `quantity` column is directly comparable, because the units in the corresponding rows of the `unit` column vary! Sometimes the number in this column is defined in terms of \"Metric tons, thousand\", and sometimes in \"Kilowatt-hours, million\" - evidently very different concepts!\n",

    "\n",
    "* Work with large datasets and explore these using basic string matching to find interesting columns, and reformat the results into more convenient formats\n",
    "* Pivot between wide and narrow formats\n",
    "* Do some basic data cleaning\n",
    "* Use the `apply()` method in `pandas` with built-in functions and custom functions\n",
